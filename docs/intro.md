# About

Let's discover what is **sero**.

## Intro

This project is essentially a revamp of the well-known **[surge.sh](https://surge.sh)** platform. While **[surge.sh](https://surge.sh)** is a fantastic tool for publishing web applications, I noticed it lacked certain features that could significantly enhance its utility. Therefore, I decided to create my own version, incorporating those missing elements to provide a more comprehensive and seamless user experience.

One key feature that it is self-hosted. This gives users more flexibility and control over their projects, allowing them to truly make their work their own. My goal with this project is to create a platform that not only meets but exceeds the needs of web developers, making the process of publishing web applications as hassle-free and efficient as possible. It also has some features that are not in **[surge.sh](https://surge.sh)**

**So saying shortly this is a simple web server with an ability to deploy it with `custom` subdomain using cli tool.**
